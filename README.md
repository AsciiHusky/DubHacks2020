# DubHacks2020
The website we have produced have some bugs, as the interactive programs aren't running as it should be.
We spoke with a mentor about this issue and it appears to be that since we used a web builder "SquareSpace"
and coded into the web builder, he wasn't able to determine and fix the issue since he wasn't familiar with 
the framework.
We have provided an Expected output and Actual Output Comparism.
Please let us know what we can do to fix this issue!
